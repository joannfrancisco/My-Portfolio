            <p>Hello again! Thanks for coming this far! ðŸ¤—</p>
            <p>
              I was a former banker here in the Philippines with 15 years of
              experience in customer service and management. Now, Iâ€™m starting a
              brand-new journey as a full-stack developer. I may still be
              considered a junior, but I have the passion and drive to hone my
              skills in creating websites that truly capture the audienceâ€™s
              attention. For me, itâ€™s never too late to chase your dreams and
              this career shift is proof of that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m excited to help you design and build a website that truly
              stands out. ðŸ¤—
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>All the best,</p>
            <p>â™¥ Jo Ann Francisco â™¥</p>
