            <p>Hello again! Thanks for coming this far! ðŸ¤—</p>
            <p>
              I was a former banker here in the Philippines with 15 years of
              experience in customer service and management. Now, Iâ€™m starting a
              brand-new journey as a full-stack developer. I may still be
              considered a junior, but I have the passion and drive to build
              modern, responsive websites that truly capture the audienceâ€™s
              attention. For me, itâ€™s never too late to chase your dreams and
              this career shift is proof of that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh, and one more thing, Iâ€™m a big movie lover thatâ€™s why this
              portfolio is Netflix-inspired. I had a lot of fun putting it
              together, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let me help you design and build websites that are not only
              functional but also engaging. ðŸ¤—
