            <p>Hello again! Thanks for coming this far! ðŸ¤—</p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m Jo Ann Francisco. After many years of working as a banker in
              the Philippines, Iâ€™ve started a brand-new journey as a full-stack
              developer. I may still be considered a junior, but Iâ€™m passionate
              about learning and dedicated to creating websites that truly
              connect with people. For me, itâ€™s never too late to chase your
              dreams, and this career shift is proof of that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m excited to help you design and build a website that truly
              stands out.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>All the best,</p>
            <p>Jo Ann â™¥</p>
